For a more detailed explanation of the delta system, [see here](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltabot).\n\n/u/DeltaBot has updated your user flair and created [your own wiki page](wiki_page_url) which will be updated every time you earn a delta. If you do well, you may find yourself on our [leaderboards](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/leaderboards) (the monthly one is also featured in our sidebar).\n\nGood luck, and happy CMVing!",
